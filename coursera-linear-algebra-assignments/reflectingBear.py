'''Background
Panda Bear is confused. He is trying to work out how things should look when reflected in a mirror, but is getting the wrong results. As is the way with bears, his coordinate system is not orthonormal: so what he thinks is the direction perpendicular to the mirror isn't actually the direction the mirror reflects in. Help Bear write a code that will do his matrix calculations properly!

Instructions
In this assignment you will write a Python function that will produce a transformation matrix for reflecting vectors in an arbitrarily angled mirror.

Building on the last assingment, where you wrote a code to construct an orthonormal basis that spans a set of input vectors, here you will take a matrix which takes simple form in that basis, and transform it into our starting basis. Recall the from the last video,

T=ETE^-1 
You will write a function that will construct this matrix. This assessment is not conceptually complicated, but will build and test your ability to express mathematical ideas in code. As such, your final code submission will be relatively short, but you will receive less structure on how to write it.'''

# GRADED FUNCTION
# This is the cell you should edit and submit.

# In this function, you will return the transformation matrix T,
# having built it out of an orthonormal basis set E that you create from Bear's Basis
# and a transformation matrix in the mirror's coordinates TE.
def build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis) : # The parameter bearBasis is a 2Ã—2 matrix that is passed to the function.
    # Use the gsBasis function on bearBasis to get the mirror's orthonormal basis.
    E = gsBasis(bearBasis)
    # Write a matrix in component form that perform's the mirror's reflection in the mirror's basis.
    # Recall, the mirror operates by negating the last component of a vector.
    # Replace a,b,c,d with appropriate values
    TE = np.array([[1, 0],
                   [0, -1]])
    # Combine the matrices E and TE to produce your transformation matrix.
    T = E@TE@inv(E)
    # Finally, we return the result. There is no need to change this line.
    return T

# First load Pyplot, a graph plotting library.
%matplotlib inline

# This is the matrix of Bear's basis vectors. 
bearBasis = np.array(
    [[1,   -1],
     [1.5, 2]])
# This line uses your code to build a transformation matrix for us to use.
T = build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis)

# Bear is drawn as a set of polygons, the vertices of which are placed as a matrix list of column vectors.
# We have three of these non-square matrix lists: bear_white_fur, bear_black_fur, and bear_face.
# We'll make new lists of vertices by applying the T matrix you've calculated.
reflected_bear_white_fur = T @ bear_white_fur
reflected_bear_black_fur = T @ bear_black_fur
reflected_bear_face = T @ bear_face

# This next line runs a code to set up the graphics environment.
ax = draw_mirror(bearBasis)

# We'll first plot Bear, his white fur, his black fur, and his face.
ax.fill(bear_white_fur[0], bear_white_fur[1], color=bear_white, zorder=1)
ax.fill(bear_black_fur[0], bear_black_fur[1], color=bear_black, zorder=2)
ax.plot(bear_face[0], bear_face[1], color=bear_white, zorder=3)

# Next we'll plot Bear's reflection.
ax.fill(reflected_bear_white_fur[0], reflected_bear_white_fur[1], color=bear_white, zorder=1)
ax.fill(reflected_bear_black_fur[0], reflected_bear_black_fur[1], color=bear_black, zorder=2)
